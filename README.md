This repository contains data and source code of the research that was puplished in the following article:

> Fadeev V.A., Zaidullin S.V., Nadeev A.F. (2022). [Investigation of the Bayesian and non-Bayesian time series forecasting framewo rks in appli-cation to OSS systems of the LTE/LTE-A and 5G mobile networks.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360919297_INVESTIGATION_OF_THE_BAYESIAN_AND_NON-BAYESIAN_TIME_SERIES_FORECASTING_FRAMEWORKS_IN_APPLICATION_TO_OSS_SYSTEMS_OF_THE_LTELTE-A_AND_5G_MOBILE_NETWORKS) T-Comm, vol. 16, no.4, pÑ€. 52-60. 

For better visualization use the following link:

> [E_RAB_SETUP_FR.ipynb](https://nbviewer.org/github/kirlf/lte-kpi-ts-forecasting/blob/main/src/E_RAB_SETUP_FR.ipynb) (NBViewer - Jupyter Notebook)

If local usage is preferable but `Jupyter` is not locally installed, use the `docker-compose` to run application (some problems may occur in MacOS, unfortunately).

## Next steps

I guess, the following material:
> [Predictive Analytics: Time-Series Forecasting with GRU and BiLSTM in TensorFlow](https://towardsdatascience.com/predictive-analytics-time-series-forecasting-with-gru-and-bilstm-in-tensorflow-87588c852915)

can be uses as an example for the next student research projects.
